=== import

Imports files from a folder into a location.

.Usage
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<usage_import>
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Searches `\<sourcedir>` directory and copies matching files into the
given location directory, adding them to the index. If a file is
already present in the index (no matter which location), it is not
copied unless `--duplicates` is specified. Files are never
overwritten, new filenames are generated (appending a number until a
non-existent file is found) if the a target file already exists.

The directory structure in `\<sourcedir>` is preserved in `\<location>`
directory.

.Example
----------------------------------------------------------------------
chee import -r /media/sdcard/DCIM /disk/fotos/camera2
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Searches recursively through `/media/sdcard/DCIM` and copies files to
`/disk/fotos/camera2` while preserving the folder structure below
`/media/sdcard/DCIM`. So the file
`/media/sdcard/DCIM/102ND200/DSC0645.JPG` is copied to
`/disk/fotos/camera2/102ND200/DSC0645.JPG`.
