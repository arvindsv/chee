Chee is a command line tool for managing photos.

Some features are:

- searches photos using standard file properties and image properties
  (resolution, created-time, etc)
- manages collections (created from queries and can be used in
  queries)
- copy/symlink images using a custom pattern

It is a simple program: the metadata of image (and other) files are
put in a database which can then be queried more conveniently. But
this already allows some useful features.


* Installing

** Building

[[http://scala-sbt.com][sbt]] is used for building chee. Install sbt, then clone the repository
and execute:

#+begin_src shell :exports code
sbt make-zip
#+end_src

in the source root. The result is a zip file in =target=
folder. Unpack the zip somewhere and add the resulting directory to
your =PATH=. Then the ~chee~ command should be available. Test it via

#+begin_src shell :exports code
chee version
#+end_src

** Using Nix

You can build chee with the [[http://nixos.org/nix][nix package manager]].

#+begin_src shell :exports both
nix-build https://github.com/eikek/chee/archive/master.tar.gz
#+end_src

or install it with

#+begin_src shell :exports code
nix-env -if https://github.com/eikek/chee/archive/master.tar.gz
#+end_src


* Documentation

Chee is a command line tool and comes with documentation built in. It
is accessible via the ~help~ command.

The help command provides information about chee's concepts as well as
about its commands. Help pages can be printed to stdout or viewed in a
browser. Run ~chee help~ to find out more.

The command

#+begin_src shell :exports code
chee help manual
#+end_src

opens a browser showing the complete manual.
