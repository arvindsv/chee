=== add

Adds files and directories to the index.

.Usage
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<usage_add>
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The options are self explaining: without any options, chee searches a
given directory for image and video files. This means it looks for
files with content type `image/*` and `video/*`. It skips all
directories and files starting with `.`. You can change this
restriction by either specifying `--all`, which disables this
condition, or by changing it in the config file. You can further
restrict the set of files by specifying a query with `--query`.

Each given directory is added as the xref:_locations[location] to the
index. If a file is given, its parent directory is used.
