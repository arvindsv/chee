.Usage
----------------------------------------------------------------------
{usage-mktree}
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To select the files to symlink or copy, the same options as for the
`find` command are used. Additionally, there are options that control
the target filename and whether to overwrite existing files or not.

The `--overwrite` option tells chee to overwrite existing files. By
default, they are skipped.

The `--pattern` option is used to determine the target filename. This
is a xref:_format_patterns[format pattern] and the default value
will make a filename like this:
`<year>/<month>/<day>-<hour>-<minute>_<filename>`. That is, files are
sorted in a directory structure based on their `created` or
`lastmodified` property. As with the `find` command, you can specify a
pattern at the command line or refer to a pattern from the config
file under the key `chee.formats`.

The `--target` option specifies the directory to transfer
files to. The name that results from `--pattern` is appended to
this. It is by default the current working directory. If a target
directory does not exist, it is created.

The `query` argument is the query string that is run against the index
or a directory (if `-f` is given). See xref:_query[query] concept page
for details.

Only one action option should be specified, if more are given, the
last option wins.
