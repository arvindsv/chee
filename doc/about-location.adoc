=== Locations

Locations are directories with images that chee queries by
default.

Chee can be used to query images anywhere in the file system. But
since most of the time photos are stored at the same places, chee can
index them into a database and perform queries much faster. If you add
a directory with images to the index, this directory is refered to as
“location”. Chee tries to normalise these such that no nested location
exists. For instance, if you add directory `/a/b/c` and then `/a/b`,
chee will update the former location to `/a/b`.

Images from other directories can be “imported“ into a location. Chee
simply copies the files and skips any duplicate by default.
