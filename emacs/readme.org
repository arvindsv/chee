#+title: Chee for Emacs

This is an Emacs interfale to the chee cli program. It uses [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html#Dired][dired]] and
[[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Image_002dDired.html#Image_002dDired][image-dired]].

It provides a special buffer where you can edit chee queries. Then
chee is called in a subprocess and the results are added to a dired
buffer and a thumbnail buffer.

* Installation

You must first install chee cli program. Please refer to the readme in
the root folder.

If chee is installed, use the following lines in Emacs to load the
interface:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports code
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/chee/emacs")
(require 'chee)
(chee-setup-default)
#+end_src

The entry point function is ~chee-query-open~ which opens a buffer
where you can edit the arguments to chee (i.e. the query). From this
buffer, run the query with ~C-c C-c~. The function
~chee-setup-default~ puts this function under key ~C-c C-s~ in the
~global-map~.


* Usage

#+title: Example
[[file:example.gif]]

Run ~chee-query-open~ and write a query. Run the query using ~C-c
C-c~. Results are added to a dired buffer and an image-dired buffer.
