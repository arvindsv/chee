#+title: Chee for Emacs

This is an Emacs client for the chee cli program. It uses [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html#Dired][dired]] and
[[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Image_002dDired.html#Image_002dDired][image-dired]].

It provides a special buffer where you can edit chee queries. Then
chee is called in a subprocess and the results are added to a dired
buffer and a thumbnail buffer.
